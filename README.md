# Automation of Timetable Reconfigurations
This project involved the automation of a standard timetable change within school.
CSV files were imported from the main data managment system and then data was prepped for processing.
The required short term changes were then created.
An output excel file was then created to present changes in a readable manor to be shared with the school.
